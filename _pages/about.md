Welcome to my website! 

My name is Akrit Mudvari, and I am currently pursuing a PhD at Yale, with a focus on the intersection of machine learning methods and next generation networked systems. I am broadly interested in exploring how different deep learning methods, including supervised and reinforcement learning approaches, could be leveraged to optimize the efficiency of the communication networks of the near future. And I am also interested in how such communication infrastructures can be harnessed to realize efficient deployment of deep learning architectures (for learning and inference tasks). 

My interests span different network paradigms including 5G and beyond cellular network, software defined networking, network function virtualization, time sensitive network, segment routing, p4, and more. And I am also interested in exploring a wide range of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other machine learning approaches. I have also worked on different testbed deployments for realistic measurements, including as a part of my PhD work and during the internships. 

For further details on my efforts and accomplishments, please explore my website, Linkedin profile, or the resume.
