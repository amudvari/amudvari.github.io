Welcome to my website! 

My name is Akrit Mudvari, and I'm currently pursuing at Yale, with a focus on the intersection of machine learning methods and next generation networked systems. I am broadly interested in exploring how different deep learning methods, including supervised and reinforcement learning approaches, could be leveraged to optimize the efficiency of the communication networks of the near future. And I am also interested in how such communication infrastructures can be harnessed to realize efficient deployment of deep learning architectures (for learning and inference tasks). 

My interests span different network paradigms including 5G and beyond cellular network, software defined networking, time sensitive network, segment routing, p4, and more. And I have found myself exploring a wide range of supervised machine learning as well as reinforcement learning approaches to discern the optimal methods in the communication realm. I have also worked on different testbed deployments for realistic measurements, including as a part of my PhD work and during the internships. 

For further details on my efforts and accomplishments, please explore my website, Linkedin profile, or the resume.
